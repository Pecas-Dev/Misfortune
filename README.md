# Notes


```diff
- **VIEWER DISCRETION**
```
**Misfortune contains some strobing visual effects that may affect photosensitive players.**

----------------------------------------------------------


 <br>

- ​It is **recommended** that you **play the game with the Windows Download** if you want a **more complete experience**, due that WebGL compresses some assets like sounds that will not be heard ​during the gameplay in the WebGL version, but will be heard ​during the Windows Version.

- _Thank you so much to the Eepy team members, this wouldn't have been possible without your amazing work!!!_
